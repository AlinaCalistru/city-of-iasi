				<h3>Exhibition Park</h3>
				<p>Children learn through play, movement, communication, and sensory experience which the outdoors provides for on a much greater scale than indoors.</p>
				<p>Children who play outside are also less likely to get sick, to be stressed or become aggressive, and are more adaptable to lifeâ€™s unpredictable turn. We have some ideas to encourage outdoor play, from creating an inviting environment, to having suitable resources on hand to play with, whatever the weather!</p>
				<p> The park was recently renovated and consists of various types of swings, slides, climbing frames and imaginative contraptions to suit children of all ages. Great park! Plenty to play on inside and outside of the play area.</p>

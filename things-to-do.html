				<h3>Eat and  Drink</h3>
				<p> Best places to enjoy the traditional romanian food and music are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span>Bolta Rece</span> - It is  Historical place (since 1786). You can eat traditional romanian food and  listen live romanian music.
It is a very old place, they managed to keep that atmosphere from centuries ago. You imagined for a moment, somewhere in a dark corner,that you can meet great personalities like Ion Creangă and Mihai Eminescu sitting on a table, eating and talking. This place is not supposed to be fancy or fine-dining. 
Very good food, tasty and traditional. A romanian band (taraf) plays live music. The singer has a very pleasant voice. Great atmosphere! </li>
					<li><span>Vivo</span> - Burger heaven They do the best burgers in Iasi. Cooked to perfection and just so appetising and tasty. The cheesy fries are to die for. Nice staff and always high quality products. It's a must visit place to eat.</li>
					<li><span>Restaurant Oscar</span> - It is a restaurant that deserves to have dinner at least once in your stay in Iasi. 
The food was excellent. The service is excellent. Prices are reasonable.</li>

			<p><span>City of Iasi</span> is the second largest city in Romania, and the seat of Iasi County. Located in the historical region of Moldavia, Iasi has traditionally been one of the leading centres of Romanian social, cultural, academic and artistic life. The city was the capital of the Principality of Moldavia from 1564 to 1859, then of the United Principalities from 1859 to 1862, and the capital of Romania from 1916 to 1918.</p>

			<p>Known as The Cultural Capital of Romania, Iasi is a symbol in Romanian history. The historian Nicolae Iorga said "There should be no Romanian who does not know of it". Still referred to as The Moldavian Capital, Iasi is the main economic and business centre of the Moldavian region of Romania. In December 2018, Iasi was officially declared Historical capital of Romania.</p>

			<p> The social and cultural life revolves around the Vasile Alecsandri National Theater - the oldest theatre in Romania, the Moldova State Philharmonic, the Opera House, the Iasi Athenaeum, a famous Botanical Garden - the oldest and largest in Romania, the Central University Library the oldest in Romania, the high quality cultural centres and festivals, an array of museums, memorial houses, religious and historical monuments.</p>

			<p>The opera house in Iasi started to function very early, from the beginning of the 19th century. The first performance was "La Dame Blanche" by Francois Adrien Boieldieu, in December 1833, the play from the French Theater, directed by the brothers Baptiste and Joseph Fourreaux. On February 20, 1838, the first Romanian-language premiere took place, with "Norma" by V. Bellini, just seven years after the absolute premiere. The representation took place under the auspices of the Philharmonic and the Conservatory. Since then, the opera and operetta have become a permanent presence in Iasi due to several foreign artists and high-class lyricists and, after 1920, thanks to the opera theaters in our country.</p>

			<p>Home to the oldest Romanian university and to the first engineering school, Iasi is one of the most important education and research centres of the country, and accommodates over 60,000 students in 5 public universities. The Alexandru Ioan Cuza University was the first Romanian modern university.</p>

			<p>Iasi urban area is the second most populous in Romania (after Bucharest), whereas more than 500,000 people live within its peri-urban area.</p>
